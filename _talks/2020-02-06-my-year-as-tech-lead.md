What does “Tech Lead” mean? It’s a vague title and definitions vary.

I spent a year as the tech lead on a project and I was asked to define what I thought that role meant. This talk would focus on lessons learned during that year. I’ll tell the story of what I think my role as tech lead was and draw on books and resources I found helpful along the way.
