### Help Us Make a Positive Difference

Custom Solutions is hiring a [new developer](https://z.umn.edu/asr_dev2_external) and we want it to be you! We're looking for a developer ready to drop the 'junior' from their title; a developer who has worked on Web applications and wants to improve their skills; a developer who wants opportunities for learning, advancement and professional development; a developer who wants to solve real problems faced by over 60,000 students.

#### What You'll Do

_In your first week_ you'll meet the team and learn about our portfolio and our stakeholders. You'll have time dedicated to training on Ruby, Rails and other tools we use. At the end of your first week you'll attend our weekly retrospective, where you can help shape the team's processes and goals.

_In your first month_ you'll be pairing with other members of the team, using test-driven development to deliver features. You'll help resolve problem tickets along with an experienced team member. And you'll attend some of the University's [coding meetups](http://code-people.umn.edu/) and [professional groups](https://campus-climate.umn.edu/get-involved#faculty-staff)

_In your first quarter_ you'll learn how to write robust, fast tests in RSpec and Jest while pairing on both new and long-lived Rails and JavaScript applications. You'll explore new technologies and meet the UMN IT community at events like [Hacker Hours](https://umnhackerhours.github.io), [Tech-People](http://tech-people.umn.edu), and [hackathons](http://umn.campuscodefest.org/).

_In your first year_ you'll become an experienced pair programmer familiar with the full process of application development. You'll use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to manage infrastructure. You'll configure Continuous Integration and Delivery tools to test and deploy the features you and your pair wrote.

#### Values

We build with code, but our foundations are these values

- Diversity: A mix of experiences, opinions and approaches makes all our work better
- Best Practices: Use and refine techniques like Pair Programming and Test Driven Development that result in better code
- Continuous Learning: We dedicate time each week for learning new tools, languages and techniques
- Mentoring: Take what you have learned and return it to the community

#### Benefits

The Office of Human Resources has a [guide to the University's benefits](https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits) including the [Regent's Scholarship](https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits/tuition-benefits), [Faculty Retirement Plan](http://humanresources.umn.edu/employee-benefits/retirement#anchor-auto), [Leave](https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits/vacations-and-leaves), and [Medical](https://humanresources.umn.edu/employee-benefits/medical).

For this job we have funding for a salary range of 70,000 to 75,000.

### How to Apply

Ready to apply? Great! Start at [the job posting](https://z.umn.edu/asr_dev2_external).

Before you start, you should have:

- A resume
   - Formatted or a plain text document, either is fine
- A cover letter
  - Explain why you're interested in the job and why you're a good candidate
- Names and contact information for three references
  - Mentors, bosses, co-workers, people you study with or talk to at meetups

**We place a lot of value on the cover letter**. Let us say that again: **_we place a lot of value on the cover letter_**. Tell us what excites you about this job, work you've done and where you want your career to go. This is more interesting to us than a list of technologies you've used.

You can take a break at any point during the application process. Click the **Save Draft** button and you can return to your application later. When you log back into the job application system, click **My Activities** and then click on the job title **Developer 2 (9790D2) - Temporary/2 years**

If you have any questions while applying, look at the [Using the Job Application System](http://humanresources.umn.edu/find-job/using-employment-system) page.

### Interviews

We use three interviews. 

1. Meet with a small group of ASR employees to discuss the job, your previous experience, and your qualifications.
1. A short take-home exercise
1. Pair programming with Custom Solutions developers using your programming language of choice.

Oh, and we won't ask you to code anything on a whiteboard.

Each interview takes about 2 hours. Some interviews can be done on the same day, or on different days, depending on your needs. We can also arrange for remote interviews.
