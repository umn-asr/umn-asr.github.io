### Help Us Make a Positive Difference

Custom Solutions is hiring a [new developer](https://z.umn.edu/asr_dev2_external) and we want it to be you! We're looking for a developer ready to drop the 'junior' from their title; a developer who has worked on Web applications and wants to improve their skills; a developer who wants opportunities for learning, advancement and professional development; a developer who wants to solve real problems faced by over 60,000 students.

You'll work in small groups, developing web applications that improve the student experience at the U and that improve your skills as a developer.
And we set aside time each week to work with developers across the University through collaborative projects, [meetups](http://code-people.umn.edu/) and [hackathons](http://umn.campuscodefest.org/).

####  Values

We build with code, but our foundations are these values

- Diversity: A mix of experiences, opinions and approaches makes all our work better
- Best Practices: Use and refine techniques like Pair Programming and Test Driven Development that result in better code
- Continuous Learning: We dedicate time each week for learning new tools, languages and techniques
- Mentoring: Take what you have learned and return it to the community

#### Benefits

The Office of Human Resources has a [guide to the University's benefits](https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits) including the [Regent's Scholarship](https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits/tuition-benefits), [Faculty Retirement Plan](http://humanresources.umn.edu/employee-benefits/retirement#anchor-auto), [Leave](https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits/vacations-and-leaves), and [Medical](https://humanresources.umn.edu/employee-benefits/medical).

For this job we have funding for a salary range of 70,000 to 75,000.

##### Why Does the Job Title say Temporary?

We currently have guaranteed funding for two years, but our intention is to make this job a permanent position. For now we must list it as 'Temporary'.

### How to Apply

Ready to apply? Great! Start at [the job posting](https://z.umn.edu/asr_dev2_external).

Before you start, you should have:

- A resume
   - Formatted or a plain text document, either is fine
- A cover letter
  - Explain why you're interested in the job and why you're a good candidate
- Names and contact information for three references
  - Mentors, bosses, co-workers, people you study with or talk to at meetups

**We place a lot of value on the cover letter**. Let us say that again: **_we place a lot of value on the cover letter_**. Tell us what excites you about this job, work you've done and where you want your career to go. This is more interesting to us than a list of technologies you've used.

You can take a break at any point during the application process. Click the **Save Draft** button and you can return to your application later. When you log back into the job application system, click **My Activities** and then click on the job title **Developer 2 (9790D2) - Temporary/2 years**

If you have any questions while applying, look at the <a href="http://humanresources.umn.edu/find-job/using-employment-system">Using the Job Application System</a> page.

### Interviews

We use three interviews. 

1. Meet with a small group of ASR employees to discuss the job, your previous experience, and your qualifications.
1. A short take-home exercise
1. Pair programming with Custom Solutions developers using your programming language of choice.

Oh, and we won't ask you to code anything on a whiteboard.

Each interview takes about 2 hours and will be on different days. We can also arrange for remote interviews.
