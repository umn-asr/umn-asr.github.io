# Jobs
## We want to work with you

### Developer 3

<a href="http://asr.umn.edu/">ASR</a> Custom Solutions is hiring a new developer and we want it to be you! We're looking for a developer ready to lead.

Developer 3s are our "Tech Leads". They design and architect our applications. They pair program to deliver high quality code. They improve the team's practices. And they improve themselves by mentoring, speaking and helping the U's IT community.

ASR Custom Solutions delivers applications that improve the student experience at the U. We've listed some of our tools over on our [projects page](projects.html). Most of our work is in Ruby, though we also work in JavaScript, Elixir, and Rust. Beyond our portfolio we set aside time each week to work with developers across the University through collaborative projects, <a href="http://code-people.umn.edu/">meetups</a>, and <a href="http://umn.campuscodefest.org/">hackathons</a>.

## Values

Our sites are built with code, but their foundation is our team values

- Diversity: A mix of experiences, opinions and approaches makes all our work better
- Best Practices: Use and refine techniques like Pair Programming and Test Driven Development that result in better code
- Continuous Learning: We dedicate time each week for learning new tools, languages and techniques
- Mentoring: Take what you have learned and return it to the community

## Benefits

The Office of Human Resources has a <a href="https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits">guide to all of the University's benefits</a>, including the <a href="https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits/tuition-benefits">Regent's Scholarship</a>, <a href="http://humanresources.umn.edu/employee-benefits/retirement#anchor-auto">Faculty Retirement Plan</a>, <a href="https://humanresources.umn.edu/benefits/vacations-and-leaves">Leave</a> and <a href="https://humanresources.umn.edu/employee-benefits/medical">Medical</a>

Salary for this job is between $95,000 and $97,000.

## Interviews

We use three interviews. In the first you'll meet with a small group of ASR employees to discuss the job, your previous experience, and your qualifications. The first interview can be done remotely. This interview takes 60-90 minutes.

The second interview is a take home design and architecture project, followed by a discussion (in person or remote). The take home work should take a few hours, the discussion takes 30-60 minutes.

In the third interview you'll pair program with Custom Solutions developers using your programming language of choice. This interview takes 60-90 minutes.

Each interview will be scheduled on different days.

Oh, and we won't ask you to code anything on a whiteboard.
