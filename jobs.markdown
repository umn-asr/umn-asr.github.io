### Help Us Make a Positive Difference

[The Application Development team is hiring a new developer](https://z.umn.edu/asr_ror_job_external) and we want it to be you! We're looking for a developer who:

* is ready to drop the "junior" from their title
* has worked on Web applications and wants to improve their skills
* wants opportunities for learning, advancement and professional development
* wants to solve real problems faced by over 60,000 students

#### What You'll Do

_In your first week_ you'll meet the team and learn about our portfolio and our stakeholders. You'll have time dedicated to training on Ruby, Rails and other tools we use. At the end of your first week you'll attend our weekly retrospective, where you can help shape the team's processes and goals.

_In your first month_ you'll be pairing with other members of the team, using test-driven development to deliver features. You'll help resolve problem tickets along with an experienced team member. And you'll attend some of the University's [coding meetups](http://code-people.umn.edu/) and [professional groups](https://campus-climate.umn.edu/get-involved#faculty-staff)

_In your first quarter_ you'll learn how to write robust, fast tests in RSpec and Jest while pairing on Rails and JavaScript applications. You'll explore new technologies and meet the UMN IT community at events like [Hacker Hours](https://umnhackerhours.github.io), [Tech-People](http://tech-people.umn.edu), and [hackathons](http://umn.campuscodefest.org/).

_In your first year_ you'll become an experienced pair programmer familiar with the full process of application development. You'll use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to manage infrastructure. You'll configure Continuous Integration and Delivery tools to test and deploy the features you and your pair wrote.

#### Values

We build with code, but our foundations are these values

- Diversity: A mix of experiences, opinions and approaches makes all our work better
- Best Practices: Use and refine techniques like Pair Programming and Test Driven Development that result in better code
- Continuous Learning: We dedicate time each week for learning new tools, languages and techniques
- Mentoring: Take what you have learned and return it to the community
