ASR Application Development has a wide-ranging portfolio of Rails apps, Ruby gems, CLI tools and more. Some of our projects are:

### Student Degree Progress

#### How Close Am I To Graduation?

Student Degree Progress (SDP) answers that important question. A data-pipeline application that integrates data from multiple applications, SDP provides data for web services, reports, alerts and analytics across the University.

----

### Tuition and Fee Management

#### How Much Does This Class Cost?

The Tuition And Fee Management System (TFMS) is the system-of-record for tuition and fees paid by students. Used across all campuses to make sure students pay the right amount for their classes.

----

### One Stop

#### How Do I...?

The One Stop website is how students across the entire UMN system get the answer the questions they need answered. ASR Application Development's expertise led to a site that is useful, accessible and responsive.

----

### Workflows

Using WorkflowGen, we develop tools for students to transfer colleges, finish their post-graduate work and take the courses they need to graduate.

----

### One Stop Queue

A hybrid application that uses Ember, Rails and web sockets to help students get better help, faster from our One Stop counselors.

----

### Web Services

Where possible we create public JSON endpoints to serve public data. Some examples:

- [Term](http://terms.umn.edu/active/today) - What term is it today?
- [Courses](https://courses.umn.edu/campuses/umnmo/terms/1175/courses.json) - What courses are offered by Campus and Term?
- [Lib Ed](http://liberal-education-courses.umn.edu/) - What courses satisfy the campus' liberal education requirements?

### Gems, Tools, Etc

When we solve a common problem we try to share what we've learned: either as a Ruby Gem, a stand-alone tool or a blog post.
