A practice our team here at Custom Solutions has been experimenting with for the past ~year and a half is having retrospectives between pairs. We typically work with the same pair partner throughout a two/three week sprint. The idea is to spend time at the end of the week with your pair reflecting on how that week of working together went. This gives time to ask how things are going and how potentially new pairing practices are working out.

How this usually goes is we take a meandering walk around campus discussing the week. Stories we worked on together, challenges that week, wins and general feedback. I always try to ask for constructive criticism on things I could do better on as a pair. Similarly, offering feedback as to things the pair did great on or could improve on.

For a sprint working on something that involves pairing on writing code (Rails, Kafka work, operational work etc) this is all fine and dandy as we have familiar structure to follow.

For sprints involving working on less common tasks like researching new technologies or maintenance on legacy software, this is harder to do.
